# This week

- we'll add a 3rd party library ([libjpeg-turbo](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/)) to load JPEG files and
- start implementing the statistics methods as well as the arithmetic operators.
- That means we'll be able to run some very basic image processing based on point operators.
- We'll also integrate a 3rd party library ([GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)) for unit testing.
- We'll generate the automatic documentation from the header file.

Don't worry if both the [libjpeg-turbo](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/) and [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) are not installed on your computer. CMake will take care of it.
But before we start, make sure to install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.org/) from [https://www.doxygen.org/](https://www.doxygen.org/).
